# Obstacle Remover Simulator

Game: Obstacle Remover Simulator                                       
Created by: Kevin Huang

Objective: 
The goal is to clear all the obstacles on your lawn.                             
When the player stands adjacent to the obstacle, then when you click, 
the player will drain the health of the bush (20hp) or the rock (40hp). Every 1 dmg of click you gain 5 dollars.                 
When you gain 300 dollars you can buy the upgrade from the shop increasing you dmg per click to 2, allowing you
to gain more $ and clear the obstacles faster.                     
(This is accesible through the menu screen(ENTER) and then the shop screen(click on the shop button))
